[description]
memorycard=A memory card is an item that can store circuit network signals. There is no limit on the number of signals stored.
memorycard-empty=This card is empty. Insert it into a Memory card writer that is connected to a circuit network to save its data.
memorycard-reader=Outputs to the circuit network the signals that are written on the inserted memory card.
memorycard-writer=Reads the signals from the circuit network and writes them on the inserted memory card. This process takes time and by default the signals are combined from both wires at the end of the write. There is also an option to write the data to red and green channels separately. The write operation overwrites anything that was written on the card.
memorycards-signal-inserted=A memory card reader sends this signal with a value 1 when a memory card is inserted.
