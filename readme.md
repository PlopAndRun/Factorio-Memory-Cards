## New Content
This mod adds a memory card item, a memory card writer machine and a memory card reader machine.

A memory card can store any amount of circuit network signals. 

To write signals on a card you need to insert it into a memory cards writer. When the write operation is finished all its signals will get saved on the memory card.

To read the stored signals you need to insert a card into a memory card reader. When a card is inserted, the reader will send a special signal plus the card's contents to the connected wires.

Inserters can insert cards into writers and readers, as well as remove them from these devices.

You can view and edit memory cards manually with a helpful editor that can be opened from shortcuts (near other tools like copy, pase and the blueprint creator). This editor shows you every signal that is written on the memory card. You can copy these signals from the inserted card to the editor's memory to edit them. After that, you can write the new values back to the same card, or to another card.

## Channel support
Writers and the editor have an option to write data to separate channels on the memory card. By default this option is disabled, but to enable it you can open the writer's UI and check the checkbox 'Write channels separately'. The editor has a switch near each signal that selects the signal's color. Colorless signals will be read into both channels.
